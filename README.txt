Grappling Garry Plus
By: Donny Le 

Goal of the game: Climb up by grappling (click on the non-red circles) on the drones. Get near misses to increase your score multiplier. Avoid the bombs. The drones are the non-red circles while the bombs are the red circles. There are three different abilities, an orange circle that sends out projectiles and blows up the bombs, a green circle that gives you a combo, and a yellow circle that gives you an extra life. The character moves faster and the bomb placement gets harder as you get more points. The special drones also get more rare.  

How to run the project: When you start the game (run main.py), input your username (case-sensitive) and select the blue button, "Play Game". You may also need to click on an empty tkinter applet. 

External Libraries and Modules: The game consists of four files: main.py, data.txt, objects.py, and layers.py. Main.py utilizes modules from objects.py and layers.py (and vice versa). Data.txt stores scores. The only other external libraries/modules used are random, math, and cmu112graphics. 

Note: The recommended path mode does not work. Any help finding the bugs would be appreciated.
